# Trust-Region-Newton-Method

This project involves the implementation of Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 proposed by lin et al.(2008) in [Trust Region Newton Method for Large-Scale Logistic Regression](http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/papers/logistic.pdf).
It is implemented in C++ and Python both, to compare them based on the time taken.

Python was slow for smaller datasets (a9a and real-sim.svml) but faster on remaining two.
